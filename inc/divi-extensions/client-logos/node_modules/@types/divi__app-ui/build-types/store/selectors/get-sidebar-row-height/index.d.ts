 * Get sidebar row's height.
 *
 * Sidebar row height is calculated based on several consideration.
 * 1. If sidebar row has fixed height, then use fixed height value.
 * 2. If sidebar height has no fixed height, then it is being calculated based on the following formula:
 * 2.1. Get app frame height (can't use app window height because of responsive mode behaviour)
 * 2.2. Substract by sum of sidebar rows that has fixed height
 * 2.3. The remaining value is divided by the amount of sidebar row that has no fixed height.
