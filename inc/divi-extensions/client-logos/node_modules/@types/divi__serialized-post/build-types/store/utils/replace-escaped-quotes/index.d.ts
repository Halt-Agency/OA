/**
 * Replace escaped quotes with regular quotes.
 *
 * This function to fix the escaped quotes in the serialized block when there are any attributes ended with a backslash.
 * During the serialization process, the Gutenberg serializer will escape `\"` to `\\u0022`, this intended to bypass
 * server stripslashes behavior which would unescape stringify's escaping of quotation mark. But this being a problem
 * when the backslash is at the end of the string, resulting the serialized block to be invalid JSON.
 *
 * Example Case 1: {"foo":"Ba\"r"} will be escaped to {"foo":"Ba\\u0022r"}
 * Example Case 2: {"foo":"Bar\"} will be escaped to {"foo":"Bar\\u0022}.
 *
 * As we can see, the second example will result in invalid JSON, so we need to replace `\\u0022` with `\\"` to fix it.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/4d5fd5a01f758d19568c885fadbc9b57ba30fb2d/packages/blocks/src/api/serializer.js#L278
 *
 * @since ??
 *
 * @param {string} serialized The serialized block to replace escaped quotes.
 *
 * @returns {string} The serialized block with escaped quotes replaced with regular quotes.
