/**
 * Fetch.
 *
 * A lightweight wrapper on native `fetch` with additional options to make working with WP Rest API easier.
 *
 * This is the preferred way of making fetch requests in Divi and will allow developers to use a centralized function
 * to have complete control over async network requests. This utility is going to be expanded and probably exported to
 * its own package in time.
 *
 * @since ??
 *
 * @param {object} options Accepts all native `fetch` parameters as well as WP Rest API specific ones.
 * @param {string} options.restRoute `REST API` endpoint to fetch.
 * @param {object} options.data Data to send to the endpoint.
 * @param {object} options.headers Headers to send to the endpoint.
 * @param {string} options.url URL to send to the endpoint.
 * @param {string} options.parseResponse Parse response to send to the endpoint.
 * @param {string} options.timeout Timeout to send to the endpoint.
 * @param {string} options.responseType Response type to send to the endpoint. Accepts `json` or `stream`.
 * @param {string} options.onDownloadProgress Callback function to call with download progress.
 * @param {string} options.forceRequest Whether to force the request.
 * @param {string} options.batchRequest Whether to sent request as batch.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<any>} Response promise on success, Rejected promise if parsing response fails,
 * or HTTP status is not 2xx OK .
