/**
 * Mock data of attrsMaps (Attribute Maps) that is generated from group component.
 * This is meant for testing purpose.
 *
 * Potential FAQ: Why not just use this directly?
 * A: Fixed maps means third party can't add their stuff to the maps or modify existing stuff on the map.
 * On top of it, fixed field definitions is avoided in D5i. It tends to grow into performance bottleneck
 * based on how things progressed in D4.
 *
 * Note for future: whenever field / attribute is added to this group component, this will need to be updated.
 *
 * @since ??
