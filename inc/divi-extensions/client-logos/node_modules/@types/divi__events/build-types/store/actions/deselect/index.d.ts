/**
 * Deselects a selected module.
 *
 * Dispatches an action to deselect a module.
 *
 * This function is typically used as an event callback when the mousetrap is clicked on.
 * It checks whether the module is already selected, and if it is, it dispatches an action to remove the selection.
 * If the module is not selected, additional logic is executed to determine if a range of modules should be
 * selected based on the shift key press.
 * If the shift key is pressed and there are selected and sibling modules, the range selection is performed,
 * selecting all modules between the previously selected one and the current one.
 *
 * If no key is pressed or the command key is pressed, the current selection is cleared before a new selection is made.
 * The text selection is deselected to prevent any flashes of text selection after module selection export.
