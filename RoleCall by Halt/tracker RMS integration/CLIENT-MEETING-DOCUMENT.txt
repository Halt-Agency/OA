═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. WHAT THIS INTEGRATION DOES (PLAIN ENGLISH)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION:

When someone fills out a form on your website, their information automatically 
goes into TrackerRMS - your recruitment and contact management system.

Think of it like this:
• Your website is the "front door" where people come in
• TrackerRMS is your "filing cabinet" where you organize and manage them
• The integration is the "courier" that carries information between them


WHAT IT DOES AUTOMATICALLY:

✓ Job Applications → Creates candidates in TrackerRMS + links them to the job
✓ CV Uploads → Creates candidate profiles in TrackerRMS
✓ Event Registrations → Saves attendees and creates contacts
✓ Content Downloads → Creates sales leads for follow-up
✓ Newsletter Signups → Creates marketing contacts
✓ Client Briefs → Creates sales opportunities with full context
✓ Job Postings → Syncs from TrackerRMS to your website in real-time


WHAT IT PREVENTS:

✗ Manual data entry (no more copy-pasting from emails)
✗ Duplicate contacts (checks if someone already exists)
✗ Lost leads (everything captured automatically)
✗ Outdated job listings (syncs instantly when you update TrackerRMS)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
3. DIFFERENT TYPES OF FORMS AND WHERE DATA GOES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You can have different forms on your website, and each one sends data to the 
right place in TrackerRMS:


FORM TYPE 1: CV UPLOADS / JOB APPLICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────
Where: "Upload Your CV" page, "Apply for Job" pages
What it collects: Name, email, phone, CV, experience
Where it goes: CANDIDATES (Resources) in TrackerRMS
What happens: Creates candidate profile, if applying for specific job, 
              automatically adds them to that job's applicant list

Example: Jane uploads her CV → She appears as a candidate in TrackerRMS → 
         Your recruiters can view her profile, match her to jobs, contact her


FORM TYPE 2: EVENT REGISTRATIONS
─────────────────────────────────
Where: Event pages (conferences, networking events, seminars)
What it collects: Name, email, phone, dietary requirements, ticket type
Where it goes: CONTACTS in TrackerRMS + ATTENDEES list in WordPress
What happens: Creates contact in TrackerRMS, creates attendee record in 
              WordPress linked to specific event

Example: John registers for "Summer Conference 2025" → Contact created in 
         TrackerRMS → Attendee record in WordPress → You can manage event 
         capacity, send updates, check people in on the day


FORM TYPE 3: CONTENT DOWNLOADS
───────────────────────────────
Where: Gated content pages (whitepapers, salary surveys, guides)
What it collects: Name, email, company, job title
Where it goes: LEADS (sales opportunities) in TrackerRMS
What happens: Creates contact, then creates lead linked to that contact

Example: Sarah downloads "Salary Survey 2025" → Contact + Lead created → 
         Tagged with what she downloaded → Your sales team can follow up: 
         "Hi Sarah, I saw you downloaded our salary survey..."


FORM TYPE 4: CLIENT BRIEFS / RFP SUBMISSIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Where: "Work With Us" page, "Submit Brief" page
What it collects: Name, email, company, requirements, budget
Where it goes: LEADS (sales opportunities) in TrackerRMS
What happens: Creates contact, creates lead with potential value

Example: Bob submits a brief for 5 roles → Lead created worth £50,000 → 
         Your sales team sees it as a hot opportunity to pursue


FORM TYPE 5: NEWSLETTER SIGNUPS
────────────────────────────────
Where: Footer, sidebar, popup newsletter forms
What it collects: Email, name (optional)
Where it goes: CONTACTS in TrackerRMS
What happens: Creates contact tagged for newsletter

Example: Alice signs up for newsletter → Contact created and tagged → 
         You manually add to Send List in TrackerRMS
         
⚠️ NOTE: There is NO automatic "Send List" API, so newsletter subscribers 
must be manually added to mailing lists in TrackerRMS. Alternative: Use 
Mailchimp or similar for automatic newsletter management.


FORM TYPE 6: GENERAL CONTACT FORMS
───────────────────────────────────
Where: "Contact Us" page
What it collects: Name, email, message
Where it goes: CONTACTS in TrackerRMS
What happens: Creates contact with enquiry notes

Example: Tom asks a question → Contact created → Your team responds


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
4. GDPR COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IS GDPR?

The law that protects people's personal information. When you collect someone's 
email, name, or phone number, you MUST:
• Tell them what you're doing with it
• Get their permission (where required)
• Keep it secure
• Delete it when they ask
• Only keep it as long as necessary


THE PROBLEM:

When someone fills out a form, their data goes to TWO places:
1. WordPress (for event management, job applications, etc.)
2. TrackerRMS (for contact management, recruitment, sales)

This means when someone asks you to delete their data, you must delete it from 
BOTH systems.


THE RISK:

If you collect data without proper consent or keep it too long, you could face:
• Fines up to £17.5 million or 4% of annual turnover
• Damage to reputation
• Legal action from individuals
• ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) investigations


THE SOLUTION:

✓ Clear consent checkboxes on every form (see section 5)
✓ Privacy policy explaining what you do with data
✓ Different retention periods for different purposes (see section 6)
✓ Process to delete data when requested
✓ Regular cleanup of old data


DUAL STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS:

When someone submits a form:
• Data stored in WordPress: For immediate functionality (attendee lists, 
  application tracking, etc.)
• Data sent to TrackerRMS: For long-term contact management, recruitment 
  pipeline, sales follow-up

GDPR requires you to:
• Explain BOTH storage locations in your privacy policy
• Delete from BOTH when requested
• Have valid legal basis for BOTH
• Apply appropriate retention periods to BOTH


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
5. REQUIRED CONSENT CHECKBOXES PER FORM TYPE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Each form needs different consent checkboxes based on what you're doing with 
the data:

  recruitment purposes. I understand you may contact me about relevant job

  trends and career advice.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
7. EVENT REGISTRATION - THREE OPTIONS TO CONSIDER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You have THREE options for handling event registrations. Each has pros and cons:


OPTION A: TRACKERRMS ONLY (SIMPLEST)
═════════════════════════════════════

HOW IT WORKS:
• Event registration creates Contact in TrackerRMS
• Tag with event name: "Summer Conference 2025"
• No special WordPress setup needed

PROS:
✓ Simple - uses existing integration
✓ One system to manage (just TrackerRMS)
✓ All contact data in one place

CONS:
✗ Manual filtering required (search by tag)
✗ No automatic capacity management
✗ Can't easily see attendee lists per event
✗ No check-in system
✗ Tags can get messy with many events

BEST FOR:
• Infrequent events (1-2 per year)
• Small events (under 20 people)
• Simple registration needs
• Teams comfortable with TrackerRMS filtering


OPTION B: WORDPRESS ONLY (MOST CONTROL)
════════════════════════════════════════

HOW IT WORKS:
• Events created as posts in WordPress
• Attendees stored as posts in WordPress
• Don't send to TrackerRMS at all
• Manage entirely on website

PROS:
✓ Full control over event management
✓ Easy capacity tracking
✓ Built-in attendee lists per event
✓ Can add check-in features
✓ Separate from TrackerRMS (clean data separation)

CONS:
✗ Event attendees not in TrackerRMS contact book
✗ Can't use for marketing follow-up in TrackerRMS
✗ No connection to recruitment/sales data
✗ Two separate databases

BEST FOR:
• Frequent events (multiple per year)
• Large events (50+ people)
• Complex requirements (capacity, check-in, ticketing)
• Events separate from recruitment/sales business


OPTION C: HYBRID (BEST OF BOTH WORLDS) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW IT WORKS:
• Events managed in WordPress (capacity, attendees, check-in)
• Registration ALSO creates Contact in TrackerRMS
• Links maintained between systems

WORDPRESS HANDLES:
• Event posts with dates, capacity, descriptions
• Attendee posts linked to events
• Capacity tracking: "45/50 spots filled"
• Dietary requirements, ticket types
• Check-in on event day
• Attendee lists and reports

TRACKERRMS HANDLES:
• Contact record for each person
• Contact history across all interactions
• Marketing consent tracking
• Future follow-up and campaigns

THE FLOW:
1. User registers for "Summer Conference 2025" on website
2. WordPress creates Attendee record (linked to Event)
3. WordPress searches TrackerRMS for existing contact
4. If found: Uses existing contact, adds activity note
5. If not found: Creates new contact
6. WordPress stores TrackerRMS contact ID with attendee

BENEFITS:
✓ Easy event management in WordPress (capacity, lists, check-in)
✓ Contact book built in TrackerRMS (for marketing, future events)
✓ No duplicate contacts (searches before creating)
✓ Complete contact history in one place
✓ Can see: "John attended 3 events, downloaded 2 resources, good contact!"

DATA FLOW EXAMPLE:
• WordPress knows: "John attended Summer Conference, needed vegetarian meal"
• TrackerRMS knows: "John is a contact at ACME Corp, attended 3 events, 
  downloaded content, opted into marketing"

BEST FOR:
• Regular events (3+ per year)
• Medium-large events (20-100+ people)
• Want to build contact database for marketing
• Want easy event management features

USE FOR: Content downloads, client briefs, RFP submissions, business enquiries

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
• Track sales pipeline
• Assign monetary value
• Follow up on interest
• Convert to clients
• Track win/loss
• Measure sales performance

EXAMPLE: Emma downloads salary survey → Lead created worth £10k → Your sales 
         team calls → She needs 5 roles filled → Becomes client worth £50k

IMPORTANT: Leads must be linked to a Contact to show email/phone in TrackerRMS.
The plugin handles this automatically - it creates the Contact first, then 
links the Lead to it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
11. SEND LISTS / NEWSLETTER MANAGEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE LIMITATION:

TrackerRMS has "Send Lists" for bulk email campaigns, but there is NO API to 
automatically add contacts to Send Lists.


YOUR OPTIONS:

OPTION 1: MANUAL ADDITION (Current Capability)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
• Newsletter form creates Contact in TrackerRMS
• Tagged with "Newsletter Subscriber"
• Someone manually adds to Send List once per week
• Viable for low volume (under 10 signups/week)

PROS: Uses existing system, no additional tools
CONS: Manual work required, potential delays


OPTION 2: MAILCHIMP / CONVERTKIT (Recommended for Newsletters)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Newsletter forms send directly to Mailchimp (not TrackerRMS)
• Automatic list management
• Proper unsubscribe handling
• Better email deliverability
• All other forms still go to TrackerRMS

PROS: Automatic, professional, GDPR compliant, better email tools
CONS: Additional monthly cost (£10-30), another system to manage


OPTION 3: HYBRID APPROACH
──────────────────────────
• Newsletter signups create Contact in TrackerRMS (for contact book)
• AND send to Mailchimp (for actual emails)
• Best of both worlds

PROS: Contact database in TrackerRMS + professional email tool
CONS: Slightly more complex, email list in two places


RECOMMENDATION:
For professional newsletter management: Use Mailchimp for emails
For contact database: Keep in TrackerRMS
This separates concerns and gives you better tools for each purpose.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
12. EVENT REGISTRATION - DETAILED COMPARISON
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's look at a real scenario to understand each option:


SCENARIO: You're hosting "Summer Conference 2025"
• Capacity: 100 people
• Expected registrations: 75 people
• Frequency: Quarterly events (4 per year)


OPTION A: TRACKERRMS TAGS ONLY
═══════════════════════════════

SETUP:
• Event registration form on website
• Creates Contact in TrackerRMS
• Tags: "Event Attendee, Summer Conference 2025"

DAY-TO-DAY USE:
• Check registrations: Filter TrackerRMS contacts by tag
• Count attendees: Manual count or export to Excel
• Send updates: Create bulk email in TrackerRMS
• Check capacity: Count doesn't auto-update
• On event day: Print list from TrackerRMS

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
1. Sarah registers → Contact created, tagged
2. You want to see total: Filter by "Summer Conference 2025" → Count manually
3. Check capacity: 45 registered, 55 spots left (manual calculation)
4. Event day: Export list, print, check people off manually
5. Next event: Need to tag differently to separate events

TIME COST: 
• 2-3 hours per event for list management
• Risk of errors in manual counting

GDPR: 
• After 6 months: Filter by tag, manually delete attendee records
• Keep contacts if marketing consent, just remove tag


OPTION B: WORDPRESS ATTENDEES CPT
══════════════════════════════════

SETUP:
• Events as Custom Post Type in WordPress
• Attendees as Custom Post Type in WordPress
• Registration creates Attendee post linked to Event
• Don't send to TrackerRMS

DAY-TO-DAY USE:
• Check registrations: View event in WordPress
• Count attendees: Automatic counter in WordPress
• Capacity: "45/100 spots filled" (live)
• Send updates: Email plugin or export list
• On event day: Mobile-friendly check-in interface

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
1. Sarah registers → Attendee post created, linked to Event post
2. View "Summer Conference 2025" → See "45/100 registered" automatically
3. Capacity nearly full? → Form shows "Only 5 spots left!"
4. Event day → Open WordPress on tablet → Check people in → Live dashboard
5. Next event → Completely separate, no tag confusion

TIME COST:
• 30 minutes per event (mostly automated)
• Clean separation between events

GDPR:
• After 6 months: Automated cleanup deletes old attendee posts
• Event-specific data automatically removed
• Clear, contained per event


OPTION C: HYBRID - WORDPRESS + TRACKERRMS
═══════════════════════════════════════════

SETUP:
• Events and Attendees in WordPress (like Option B)
• Registration ALSO creates Contact in TrackerRMS
• Attendee post stores TrackerRMS Contact ID
• Links maintained between systems

DAY-TO-DAY USE:
• Event management: All in WordPress (easy!)
• Contact history: All in TrackerRMS (complete!)
• Best of both worlds

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
1. Sarah registers for "Summer Conference 2025"
2. WordPress checks TrackerRMS: Is Sarah already a contact?
3. If YES: Use existing contact (she registered for last event too!)
4. If NO: Create new contact
5. WordPress creates Attendee post with TrackerRMS contact ID
6. WordPress: Easy event management
7. TrackerRMS: Complete contact history

SARAH'S JOURNEY VISIBLE IN TRACKERRMS:
• March 2025: Registered for Spring Networking Event
• May 2025: Downloaded Salary Survey
• June 2025: Registered for Summer Conference
• July 2025: Downloaded Recruitment Guide
→ You can see: "Sarah is engaged, attended 2 events, downloaded 2 resources, 
   hot prospect for marketing!"

BENEFITS:
✓ Easy event management (WordPress handles complexity)
✓ Contact database grows (every attendee captured)
✓ No duplicates (searches before creating)
✓ See complete contact history (all interactions)
✓ Marketing opportunities (can follow up with engaged attendees)
✓ GDPR compliant (clear retention for event data vs. contact data)

WORKFLOW:
• Event management: WordPress (capacity, lists, check-in)
• Contact management: TrackerRMS (history, marketing, relationships)
• Data retention: Event data deleted 6 months, contact kept if consented

TIME COST:
• 30 minutes per event (WordPress automation)
• Contact database grows automatically (no extra work)

GDPR:
• WordPress: Auto-delete attendee posts after 6 months
• TrackerRMS: Keep contact if marketing consent, otherwise review for deletion
• Clear separation: Event data (temporary) vs. Contact data (ongoing)


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
13. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES SUMMARY
